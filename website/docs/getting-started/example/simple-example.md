# Simple

<code src="../../../src/simple.tsx" title="Basic table" desc="This is the basic simple table" />

> Open the console, you can see the saved content information

## Column 

When setting the `column`, you need to pay attention to the two attributes `name` and `title` which are necessary fields. One is the name of the corresponding data, and the other is the hidden content of the table.

> For more attribute information, see [API](/getting-started/api) description
